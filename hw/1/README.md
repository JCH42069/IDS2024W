5.  git pull - pull the latest project version from the remote to the local repository, git status - check the status of the project, git add -all - to add all modified files, git commit -m'latest build' - it shows you the latest build, git push -all - to push all your commits from the local repository to the remote repository, to place them permanently there and be able to share them with others
