2. 2 ENIAC - Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer  
3. 3 To store values and run loops  
4. 4 Cache Memory  
5. 5 Disk  
6. 6 A bit  
7. 7a Assembly Language  
7. 7b yes  
8. 8a Fortran  
8. 8b Approximately 6 decades  
9. 9a Cobol  
9. 9b Third-Generation  
10. 10 1970s, 1980s, 1980s, 1990s  
11. 11 B  
12. 12 C, Simula  
13. 13 Fortran  
14. 14 Registers  
15. 15 a byte  
16. 16 much faster  
17. 17 Ram is significantly faster  
18. 18 not musch faster  
19. 19 They act as switches, letting currents through to represent the binary digit 1, or cutting it off to represent 0.  
20. 20 Because we would have to make the chips bigger and there wouldn't be enough space.  
21. 21 Fetch, decode, execute  
22. 22 It determines how many cycles of operations the processor can perform per second. A higher clock speed means the CPU can execute more cycles per second, leading to faster processing of tasks.  
23. 23 CPU because CPU would be able to support higher-end GPU  
24. 24 Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are like best buddies in the tech world. Moore's Law makes gadgets more powerful by adding more switches, and Dennard Scaling keeps them energy-efficient by making them smaller. Together, they've given us devices that are faster and better, without draining too much energy.
